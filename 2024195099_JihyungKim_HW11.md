## Q1
Yonsei University is considering implementing a new study program to improve students' academic performance. The university wants to assess whether the average GPA of students enrolled in the new program differs from the current university-wide average GPA of 3.2.

A random sample of 200 students enrolled in the new study program was taken, and their GPAs were recorded. The recorded data is in the GPA variable of the ‘HW11_dat.csv’ file.
Using the given data, test at 5% significance level whether the average GPA of students enrolled in the new study program differs from the university-wide average GPA of 3.2.

Step1: State the hypothesis \
$H_0$ : the average GPA of students enrolled in the new program is the same as the university-wide average GPA of 3.2
$$
\mu_A \quad = \quad \mu_B
$$

$H_a$ : the average GPA of students enrolled in the new program is different from the university-wide average GPA of 3.2
$$
\mu_A \quad \neq \quad \mu_B
$$

Step2: State the significance level \
$ \alpha = 0.05$


Step3: Calculate the test statistic
as we do not know the $ \sigma $ for the current university-wide GPA, and as the sample is large, we use the following expression

when using the Homogeneity of variance: $ \sigma_1 ^ 2 = \sigma_2 ^ 2 = \sigma ^ 2 $
$$
Z = \frac{(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{S^2_p (\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})}} \sim N(0,1)
$$

when using the Heterogeneity of variance: $ \sigma_1 ^ 2 \neq \sigma_2 ^ 2 $
$$
Z = \frac{(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{S^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{S^2_2}{n_2}}} \sim N(0,1)
$$

Step4: Calculate the P-value and State your conclusion

## Q2
Yonsei University is evaluating the effectiveness of a new online learning platform. Historically, 60 of the students at Yonsei University prefer traditional classroom learning over online learning. The university conducted a survey with a random sample of 200 students who have used the new online learning platform to see if the preference for traditional classroom learning has changed.
The data on the surveyed preferences is in the newplatform variable of the ‘HW11_dat.csv’ file. If a student prefers the new online learning platform, it is coded as 1, otherwise as 0. 
Using the given data, perform a hypothesis test at the 3% significance level to determine if the preference for the new online learning platform among students is greater than the historical preference rate of 60%.

Step1: State the hypothesis \
$H_0$ : the average GPA of students enrolled in the new program is the same as the university-wide average GPA of 3.2
$$
\mu_A \quad = \quad \mu_B
$$

$H_a$ : the average GPA of students enrolled in the new program is different from the university-wide average GPA of 3.2
$$
\mu_A \quad \neq \quad \mu_B
$$

Step2: State the significance level \
$ \alpha = 0.03$

Step3: Calculate the test statistic

Step4: Calculate the P-value and State your conclusion
